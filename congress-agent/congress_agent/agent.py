"""Congress.gov multi-agent orchestrator built on Google ADK.

Flow:
  1. orchestrator        -- picks the relevant skills for the user's prompt and
                            documents the plan, then fans out one skill_researcher
                            call per chosen skill, then synthesizes a final answer.
  2. skill_researcher    -- (spawned per skill) asks fetch_planner for a set of
                            fetches, performs them, and structures the results.
  3. fetch_planner       -- reads the skill's endpoint reference and proposes the
                            most useful API fetches for the sub-question.
  4. visualization_agent -- (on demand) extracts entities/relationships from the
                            conversation and opens an interactive knowledge graph.

Sub-agents are wired as AgentTools so the orchestrator can fan out dynamically
(one researcher per selected skill) rather than with a fixed-width parallel step.
