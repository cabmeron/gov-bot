"""Government-data multi-agent orchestrator built on Google ADK.

Answers questions over two APIs — Congress.gov (legislation, members, votes,
committees, ...) and OpenFEC (candidates, committees, receipts, disbursements,
campaign finance, ...) — and can mix both in a single answer.

Flow:
  1. orchestrator        -- picks the relevant skills (from either source) for
                            the user's prompt and documents the plan, then fans
                            out one skill_researcher call per chosen skill, then
                            synthesizes a final answer.
  2. skill_researcher    -- (spawned per skill) asks fetch_planner for a set of
                            fetches, performs them, and structures the results.
  3. fetch_planner       -- reads the skill's endpoint reference and proposes the
                            most useful API fetches for the sub-question.
  4. visualization_agent -- (on demand) extracts entities/relationships from the
                            conversation and opens an interactive knowledge graph.

Skills are namespaced "<source>/<group>" (e.g. "congress/bill", "fec/candidate");
the source routes each fetch to the right API via api_fetch. Sub-agents are wired
as AgentTools so the orchestrator can fan out dynamically (one researcher per
selected skill) rather than with a fixed-width parallel step.
